<h1>Ask Project</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
This is an open source project for Sage-Code Laboratory. It is a quiz web app. It enable members to tak quizzes that are pre-loaded in a database. We use Svelte, MariaDB and Rails. Any user who take this quiz must be a Sage-Code premium subscriber. License: BSD 3.0. The purpose of this project is to learn how to build a dynamic web app. We will use the app to replace Google forms on our website.
</div>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>For this application documentation is very important. We will use HTML5 and Database design diagrams to create database structure. We will initialize the database using JSON data files. Data files will be generated using AI. We load and update data using Ruby initialization scripts. There are no input dialogs except the Quiz dialog. This is a web application, is not designed for mobile phone.</p>

<p>This app will use continuous integration and release. It will be automatically deploy every week. You will be able to test this app by pressing the button below. Sometimes the APP works, sometimes is down. We don't care because this is not a production release but a test release. If you test the app, visit our GitHub repository and post feedback or submit defect or issues you have found.</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>

<p>We accept contributors. You can start by reading documentation. Also make sure you have the basic training in this technology stack. You need to know all these technologies before you can understand the code-base. If you don't know the entire stack is ok. We assign you to tasks that you can do, until you understand the entire stack and can do more.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Note: </b>You must be a a Discord member to communicate with the development team. Developers can ask for an invitation on Discord to become code maintainers. Other members can clone this app and install it locally. Testing the app locally is a requirement to be able to keep the app stable. Of course you need GitHub skills and you must know how the operating system works. You can't work remote on this app, you need Linux or Windows or Mac. You can't work from Chromium laptop, mobile or tablet.</div>


<p>Thank you for reading about the project. Ask is growing slow because we have no money for it. This is going the be hopefully fast and robust. We do not plan to use this dev stack for other applications. If it works you can learn from it and start a similar app on your own.</p>
