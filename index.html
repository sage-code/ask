<h1>Ask Project</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
This is a quiz web app. It enable members to take quizzes that are pre-loaded in a database. The purpose of this project is to learn how to build a dynamic web app. We will use the app for making an exam, it will not replace Google prep quizzes that we already have.
</div>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>For documentation we will use HTML5 and design diagrams to create a database structure. We will initialize the database using JSON data files. Data files will be generated using AI. There are no input dialogs except the Quiz dialog.</p>

<h2>Release & test</h2>

<p>This app will use continuous integration and release. It will be automatically deploy every week. You will be able to test this app by pressing the button below. Sometimes the APP works, sometimes is down. We don't care because this is not a production release but a test release. If you test the app, visit our GitHub repository and post feedback or submit defect or issues you have found.</p>

  <h2>Tech stack</h2>

  <p>Following tech stack and tools can be used to build a wide variety of web applications, from simple static websites to complex dynamic applications. The specific tools and technologies you need will depend on the specific requirements of your project.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>HTML + CSS</b></li>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the core technologies used to create web pages. HTML is used to define the structure of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. CSS is used to style the appearance of a web page, such as the font, color, and layout.</p>

    <li><b>JavaScript</b></li>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that is used to add interactivity to web pages. For example, JavaScript can be used to create animations, validate forms, and handle user input.</p>

    <li><b>MariaDB</b></li>
    <p>MariaDB is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that is used to store and manage data for web applications. MariaDB is a fork of MySQL, and it is compatible with most MySQL applications.</p>

    <li><b>Node.js</b></li>
    <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build back-end web servers and applications. Node.js is known for its scalability and performance.</p>

    <li><b>Adonis</b></li>
    <p>Adonis is a full-stack web framework for Node.js that provides a number of features to help developers build robust and scalable web applications. Adonis is based on the Laravel PHP framework.</p>

    <li><b>Svelte</b></li>
    <p>Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework that is known for its performance and ease of use. Svelte is a compiler-based framework, which means that it converts Svelte code into vanilla JavaScript code at compile time. This makes Svelte applications very fast and lightweight.</p>

    <li><b>GitHub</b></li>
    <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform that can be used to collaborate on software development projects. GitHub provides features such as version control, issue tracking, and pull requests.</p>

    <li><b>VS Studio</b></li>
    <p>Visual Studio is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) that can be used to write, debug, and test code. Visual Studio supports a variety of programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.</p>
  </ul>

<h2>Contribution</h2>

<p>We accept contributors. You can start by learning the tech stack.  You need to know all these technologies before you can understand the code-base. If you join our team, we will assign for you work items that you can resolve, until you understand the entire stack.</p>

<p><b>Repository: </b><a href="https://github.com/sage-code/ask" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ask Project</a></p>


<div class="alert alert-info"><b>Note: </b>You must be a Discord member, if you wish to communicate with the development team. Developers can ask for an invitation on GitHub. Other members can clone this app and install it locally. You can't work remote on this app, you need Linux or Windows or Mac. You can't work from Chromium laptop, mobile or tablet.</div>


<p>Thank you for reading about the project. This is going the be hopefully fast and robust app. We do not plan to use this dev stack for other applications. If it works you can learn from it and start a similar app on your own.</p>
