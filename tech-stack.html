<h1>Tech Stack</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary">We try to select one of the most prestigious tech stack to create a fast, modern and secure quiz app. We use AI to make our selection and study how to connect different components in our architecture.</div>

<h2>Shared hosting</h2> 

<p>Hosting your Quiz app on a shared hosting plan can help reduce costs and simplify deployment. Since Svelte compiles your code into a single bundle, it is easy to deploy your app to any web server that supports Node.js. MariaDB can also be installed on most shared hosting plans, making it easy to set up a scalable and secure database backend without having to manage your own server.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>

<p>Svelte, Node.js, and a backend framework like Express, Koa, or Hapi are all excellent choices for building high-performance web applications. Additionally, MariaDB is a secure and scalable database management system that provides ACID-compliant transaction support and a range of features for optimizing database performance.</p>

<h3>Svelte</h3> 

<p>Svelte is a lightweight and efficient front-end framework that compiles your code into highly optimized vanilla JavaScript. This means that your Quiz app can be delivered to users as a single, compressed bundle, resulting in faster page load times and reduced bandwidth usage. Svelte is also very fast in terms of rendering and updating components, which makes it a great choice for building complex, interactive user interfaces.</p>

<h3>Node.js</h3>

<p>Node.js is a high-performance JavaScript runtime that is designed for building scalable and efficient server-side applications. By using JavaScript on both the front-end and backend, you can streamline your development process and create a more consistent coding environment. Node.js also has a vast ecosystem of packages and modules that can be leveraged to quickly add features to your Quiz app.</p>

<h3>MariaDB</h3> 

<p>MariaDB is a drop-in replacement for MySQL that provides excellent performance and scalability, making it a great choice for high-traffic Quiz apps. It also provides advanced security features like encryption and auditing, which can help prevent data breaches and ensure compliance with industry regulations.</p>

<h2>Backend</h2> 

<p>A backend framework like Express, Koa, or Hapi provides a range of features for handling HTTP requests and responses, including routing, middleware, and templating support. This makes it easier to create a well-structured and scalable backend architecture for this Quiz app. These frameworks also support session management, which is essential for building secure Quiz apps.</p>

<p>There are several backend frameworks that can be used with a Svelte + Node.js + MySQL stack, depending on your specific requirements and preferences. Below are some of the most popular and well-regarded options</h2>

<h3>1. Express.js</h3> 
<p>Express is a minimal, flexible, and lightweight framework that is widely used with Node.js for building web applications. It provides a robust set of features for handling HTTP requests and responses, including routing, middleware, and templating support. Express is also highly customizable and can be extended with a wide range of third-party plugins and modules.</p>

<h3>2. Koa.js</h3> 
<p>Koa is a newer and more lightweight framework that is often seen as a more modern alternative to Express. It provides a similar set of features and functionality to Express, but with a more streamlined and elegant API. Koa also utilizes async/await syntax, making it easier to write scalable and maintainable code.</p>

<h3>3. Hapi.js</h3> 

<p>Hapi is another popular backend framework that is designed for building scalable and secure web applications. It provides a range of features for handling authentication, caching, input validation, logging, and more. Hapi is also known for its robust plugins ecosystem, which includes plugins for everything from database integration to security.</p>


<h2>ORM Frameworks</h2>

<p>When it comes to interacting with MariaDB from your Node.js web application, there are several great ORM frameworks and middleware options to choose from. Here are a few of the best:</p>

<h3>Sequelize ORM</h3>
<p>Sequelize is a popular ORM framework for Node.js that supports multiple databases, including MariaDB. It provides a comprehensive set of features such as data validation, eager loading, transactions, and more. Additionally, Sequelize has excellent documentation and a large community, making it easy to get started with and troubleshoot.</p>

<h3>TypeORM</h3>
<p>TypeORM is another powerful ORM framework that supports MariaDB. It enables you to use object-oriented programming paradigms to interact with databases, simplifying complex queries and reducing the time it takes to write database-related code. TypeORM also supports migrations, schema synchronization, and database seeding, making it a complete solution for database interaction tasks.</p>

<h3>Knex.js</h3>
<p>Knex.js is a versatile SQL query builder and ORM framework that supports MariaDB along with other database systems. It provides a rich set of features such as transactions, connection pooling, and supports JavaScript callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax. Knex.js is especially useful for building complex database queries.</p>

<h3>MariaDB Node.js Client</h3>
<p>MariaDB Node.js Client is a middleware that enables you to connect to MariaDB from your Node.js web application. This lightweight library offers a slew of features including SSL/TLS-based encryption, transactions, and transactions spanning multiple queries. It is a popular choice for developers who want a light-weight, minimalistic way of interacting with MariaDB from their Node.js application.</p>

<h3>NestJS</h3>
<p>NestJS is a TypeScript-based Node.js framework that is built on top of Express.js. It is opinionated and takes a modular approach to building server-side applications. It supports several databases including MariaDB, and has an extensive module ecosystem with various middleware such as typeorm, sequelize, and typeorm.</p>

<h3>Fastify</h3>
<p>Fastify is a lightweight and fast web framework for Node.js. It has a plugin-based architecture that makes it easy to add middleware and other features to your application. It has good support for MariaDB and several ORM libraries can be used with it such as objection.js, sequelize, and prisma.</p>

<h3>AdonisJS</h3>
<p>AdonisJS is a full-featured web framework for Node.js that is similar in functionality to Ruby on Rails or Laravel. It has a powerful ORM, Lucid, which is built on top of Knex.js and supports various databases including MariaDB.</p>

<h3>hapijs</h3>
<p>hapijs is a robust framework for building web applications and services. It has a plugin-based system for adding features and middleware to your application. It has good support for MariaDB and various ORM libraries can be used with it such as sequelize, bookshelf, and objection.js.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the best backend framework for your Svelte + Node.js + MySQL stack will depend on your specific needs and preferences. All of the frameworks discussed above are well-regarded and widely used within the Node.js community, so you can't go wrong with any of them.</p>
