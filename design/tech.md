## Tech Stack

When it comes to building a Quiz app that is both high performing and secure, choosing the right tech stack is critical. In this article, we will justify the use of Svelte, Ruby on Rails, and MariaDB for building a high-performance, secure Quiz app that can be hosted on a shared hosting plan.

### Svelte: For a Fast and Responsive Front-End
Svelte is a relatively new JavaScript framework that has been gaining popularity in recent years. One of the important advantages of Svelte is its small bundle sizes since it compiles most of the code during the build step. As a result, the app loads quickly, and the user interface remains responsive even on low bandwidth connections.

Moreover, Svelte leverages reactive programming to achieve high speed, making it an ideal framework for building a high-performance front-end. With Svelte, it's also possible to optimize the performance of the website using server-side rendering which is crucial to a good user experience.

### Ruby on Rails: For a Secure Backend
Ruby on Rails is one of the most popular web development frameworks used to build secure and scalable web applications. Its ease of use, comprehensive documentation, and built-in security features are some of the reasons it remains a popular choice for developers around the globe.

Rails comes with security features such as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, SQL injection protection, and built-in authentication mechanisms that make it easy to develop secure applications. Rails also has a vast library of plugins, known as gems, that include security plugins such as Devise, Cancancan, and Figaro.

### MariaDB: For a Scalable and Reliable Database
MariaDB is one of the most popular open-source databases that is a fork of MySQL. It provides both scalability and reliability, which is critical when it comes to building a high-performance Quiz app.

MariaDB supports clustering to enable load balancing and easy scaling of the database horizontally. Additionally, it also stores data in a more efficient manner than MySQL, making it faster and able to handle significantly more traffic.

### Shared Hosting Plan: For Cost-Effective Deployment
Shared hosting is one of the most cost-effective ways to deploy a Quiz app. The server is shared among multiple users, which helps to keep the costs down. The combination of Svelte, Rails, and MariaDB is great for building an app that is efficient, secure and optimized for performance, consequently making it a great option to run on a shared hosting plan.

In conclusion, when it comes to building a high-performance, secure Quiz app on a shared hosting plan, the combination of Svelte, Ruby on Rails, and MariaDB can give you the desired performance and security that your project needs. Its intuitive UI, built-in security features, reactive programming, scalability, and reliability make it an ideal framework for building stable, fast, scalable, and secure applications.
