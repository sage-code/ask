<h1>Ask Structure</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
To understand the project better, we have created this initial folder structure. We will try to keep the structure of the project consistent with this specification. The initial design of this structure was generated by RIX, a chat-bot that is capable to understand the requirements of this Quiz app. In the future we will maintain this structure synchronized with the real project.

<p><b>Note:</b>We will create readme.md files to explain each folder. Some files for example JSON files are self explanatory and do not support comments. Files that support comments will be auto-documented. Read the file content to understand the code better. This will help you learn how to code and contribute to the project.</p>

<h2>Build System</h2>

<p>It is recommended to use a JavaScript build tool when developing applications with Svelte, Vue, or React. These frameworks require a lot of code, and a build tool can help you manage and optimize that code.</p>

<p>A build tool can automate tasks such as bundling and minifying code, linting code to ensure quality, managing dependencies, and providing live reloads during development. The build tool does this by using a configuration file that specifies how the tool should process the code.</p>

<p>We chose Vite and Jest to create our Quiz App:</p>

<p>When we were tasked with creating a Quiz App, we knew that we needed a modern JavaScript build tool to streamline our development process. After careful consideration, we chose to use Vite as our go-to tool. </p>
<ul>
    
<li>Vite provides a faster and more efficient development experience by leveraging native ES modules and leveraging browser cache to skip most of the bundling process for development servers.</li>
<li>Vite's performative nature allows hot reloading, which will help our development team iterate more quickly and efficiently. </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, we are using Jest, a modern testing framework, to ensure that our Quiz App is robust and bug-free. </p>
<ul>

<li>Jest provides a simple and easy-to-use testing framework for our developers.</li>
<li>We can create snapshot and unit tests to ensure that the app is functioning as intended, without having to manually test every possible iteration of the app. </li>
<li>By using Jest, we ensure that our Quiz App is robust, reliable, and ready for deployment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, by leveraging the power of Vite and Jest, we are confident that our Quiz App will be robust, efficient, and scalable, ready to handle any challenges that come our way.</p>
