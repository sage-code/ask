<h1>Software Pileine</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
A developer pipeline is a set of automated processes that help developers build, test, and deploy software applications in a more efficient and reliable manner. 
</div>

<h2>What is a Pipeline></h2>

<p>A typical software development pipeline involves the following stages.</p>

<ul>
    <li> <b>Source code management:</b> This stage involves managing the source code by using version control systems such as Git, SVN, etc. </li>
    <li> <b>Build:</b> This stage involves compiling the source code into an executable format that can be run by the user. </li>
    <li> <b>Testing:</b> This stage involves running automated tests on the software application to ensure it meets the functional and non-functional requirements. </li>
    <li> <b>Deployment:</b> This stage involves releasing the software application into a production environment for the end-users to use. </li>
    <li> <b>Monitoring:</b> This stage involves monitoring the software application in production to ensure it is working as expected and to detect any issues or bugs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Setup a Pipeline</h2>

<p>For Ask, that is a Website Quiz App that has a Database and Quiz Questions Stored as JSON we need such a pipeline to update the quizzes all the time. So this app is special because it will remain dependent on GitHub for the entire life cycle.</h2>

<p> Here are the steps we shpuld follow to set up a pipeline for a website Quiz app that has a database and quiz questions stored in JSON:</p>

<ol>
    <li> <b>Source code management:</b> Use a version control system such as Git to manage the source code of your Quiz application. Store the quiz questions in a separate JSON file, which can be version controlled alongside the source code. </li>
    <li> <b>Build:</b> Use a build tool such as Gradle or Maven to compile the source code into a deployable artifact such as a WAR file. </li>
    <li> <b>Testing:</b> Use a testing framework such as JUnit or TestNG to write automated tests for your Quiz application. Write tests to ensure the correctness of the quiz questions and the functionality of the Quiz application. </li>
    <li> <b>Deployment:</b> Use a deployment tool such as Jenkins or Travis CI to automate the deployment of your Quiz application into a production environment. Have a CI/CD pipeline in place to enable you to push changes to production frequently and with confidence. </li>
    <li> <b>Monitoring:</b> Use a monitoring tool such as Nagios or Prometheus to monitor your Quiz application in production. Monitor the application metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and response time to detect any performance issues. </li>
</ol>
